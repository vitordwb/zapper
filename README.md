Open-source launcher for macOS: **Raycast + Wispr Flow + Speechify + Memory + AI** in one app.

Zapper is my version of SuperCmd gives you Raycast-style extension workflows, hold-to-speak dictation, natural text-to-speech, AI actions backed by configurable providers and memory, notes, canvas, clipboard history, snippet expansion, and window tiling — all from a single keyboard shortcut.


## What It Is

SuperCmd is an Electron + React launcher that focuses on Raycast extension compatibility while remaining community-driven and open source. It ships a full `@raycast/api` and `@raycast/utils` compatibility shim so existing Raycast extensions work without modification. For anything that requires tight system integration — hotkeys, window management, speech recognition, clipboard, snippet injection — it drops into Swift and Objective-C to talk directly to macOS frameworks (ApplicationServices, EventKit, AVFoundation, Carbon) for native speed and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Raycast extension compatibility** — `@raycast/api` and `@raycast/utils` shims; install extensions directly from the Raycast store
- **Raycast backup import** — import encrypted `.rayconfig` backups with settings, hotkeys, extensions, scripts, quicklinks, snippets, notes, and extension prefs
- **AI cursor prompt** — inline AI suggestions at your cursor position across any app
- **AI chat** — chat with configurable providers (OpenAI / Anthropic / Ollama / Gemini / OpenAI-compatible)
- **Hold-to-speak dictation** — Wispr Flow-style voice input; hold hotkey, speak, release to type (Whisper, Parakeet, or native macOS STT)
- **Read aloud** — Speechify-style TTS for selected text (Edge TTS or ElevenLabs)
- **Clipboard history** — full clipboard manager with Cmd+1–9 quick-paste shortcuts
- **Snippet expansion** — create and trigger text snippets with keyboard shortcuts
- **Quick links** — bookmark URLs and launch them from the launcher
- **Notes** — lightweight in-launcher note-taking
- **Canvas** — freeform drawing and diagramming
- **File search** — fast indexed file search with protected-roots support
- **Calendar/schedule** — view today's events from EventKit
- **Window tiling** — 24 window placement commands (halves, thirds, quarters, center, fill, 10px nudge/resize)
- **Hyper key** — remap Caps Lock to a custom modifier with configurable behavior
- **System commands** — Sleep, Restart, Lock Screen, Log Out, Close All Apps, Empty Trash
- **Script command support** — run custom shell/Python/Ruby scripts from the launcher
- **Auto-updates** — built-in updater via GitHub Releases; check manually or install on next launch
- **Memory-aware AI** — Supermemory integration
- **Glassy UI** — liquid-glass morphism with custom background image, blur, and opacity controls
- **Localization** — English, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish, Russian

## Install

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask supercmdlabs/supercmd/supercmd
```

### Download the app

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SuperCmdLabs/SuperCmd/releases/latest):

- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):** `SuperCmd-x.x.x-arm64.dmg`
- **Intel Mac:** `SuperCmd-x.x.x.dmg`

Open the `.dmg`, drag SuperCmd to your Applications folder, and launch it.

> **Note:** On first launch, macOS may warn that the app is from an unidentified developer. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway".

### macOS Permissions

SuperCmd needs the following permissions. The app will prompt you on first use, or you can enable them manually in **System Settings → Privacy & Security**:

| Permission | Why | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | Window management, keystroke injection | Window tiling, snippet expansion |
| **Input Monitoring** | Global hotkey detection (hold-to-speak, launcher shortcut, hyper key) | Core launcher functionality |
| **Microphone** | Voice dictation (speech-to-text) | Optional — only if using voice features |
| **Automation (AppleScript)** | Selected text capture, system automation | Extension actions |
| **Calendars** | Reading today's events | Optional — only if using schedule feature |

> You may need to restart the app after granting permissions.

### Auto-updates

SuperCmd includes a built-in auto-updater backed by GitHub Releases. You can check for updates manually by searching "Check for Updates" in the launcher, or install a downloaded update on next launch.

### Raycast Backup Import

SuperCmd can import encrypted Raycast `.rayconfig` backups from the General settings tab.

It currently imports:
- Raycast settings that map cleanly to SuperCmd
- the global launcher hotkey
- command hotkeys
- quicklinks
- snippets
- notes
- installed Raycast extensions
- extension preferences
- script command folders
- disabled script commands
- disabled extension commands

It intentionally skips or only partially maps:
- AI chats
- clipboard history
- MCP server config
- Raycast aliases, where the backup does not expose a clean first-class field

The importer decrypts backups locally and prompts for the backup password before reading the file.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** (required — native Swift modules won't compile on Linux/Windows)
- **Node.js 22+** — check with `node -v`
- **npm** — comes with Node.js
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** — required for `swiftc` (Swift compiler)
- **Homebrew** — used at runtime to resolve `git` and `npm` for extension installation

### 1. Install system dependencies

If you don't have Xcode Command Line Tools:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Verify Swift is available:
```bash
swiftc --version
```

If you don't have Homebrew:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperCmdLabs/SuperCmd.git
cd SuperCmd
npm install
```

### 3. Build native modules

The `dev` script does **not** compile the Swift native helpers — build them once before your first run:
```bash
npm run build:native
```

This compiles all Swift binaries and native Node modules into `dist/native/`.

### 4. Run in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts TypeScript watch for the main process, the Vite dev server for the renderer, and Electron in development mode.

### 5. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

Runs `build:main` + `build:renderer` + `build:native` in sequence.

### 6. Package the app
```bash
npm run package
```

Output artifacts are generated under `out/`.

### Useful Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Start local development (watch + Vite + Electron)
npm run build            # Build main, renderer, and native modules
npm run build:main       # Compile Electron main process TypeScript
npm run build:renderer   # Build renderer with Vite
npm run build:native     # Compile Swift helpers and native modules
npm run package          # Build and package app with electron-builder
npm run package:unsigned # Build unsigned package for local testing
npm run check:i18n       # Check internationalization strings
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| `swiftc: command not found` | Run `xcode-select --install` and restart your terminal |
| `npm install` fails on native modules | Ensure Xcode CLT is installed and up to date: `softwareupdate --install -a` |
| App launches but hotkeys don't work | Grant **Input Monitoring** permission (not just Accessibility) and restart the app |
| Window management doesn't work | Grant **Accessibility** permission — `window-adjust.swift` checks `AXIsProcessTrusted()` |
| Extensions fail to install | Verify Homebrew is installed (`brew --version`) — SuperCmd needs brew-resolved `git` to clone extensions |
| `node-gyp` build errors | Check Node.js version (`node -v`) — requires 22+. Try deleting `node_modules` and re-running `npm install` |
| Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) issues | Ensure you're running the arm64 version of Node.js, not the x64 version via Rosetta |
| Native features missing after `npm run dev` | Run `npm run build:native` first — the dev script doesn't compile Swift binaries |
| Snippet expansion not working | Grant **Accessibility** permission; snippet-expander uses `CGEventPost` for keystroke injection |
| Whisper/Parakeet STT not working | Grant **Microphone** permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security |

## AI + Memory Setup

Configure everything from the app UI:

1. Launch SuperCmd.
2. Open **Settings** (search "Settings" or use the gear icon).
3. Go to the **AI** tab.
4. Enable AI (`enabled = true`).
5. Pick your default provider and add the required key(s).

### Providers

| Provider | Setting | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | `openaiApiKey` | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, etc. |
| Anthropic (Claude) | `anthropicApiKey` | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Haiku, etc. |
| Google Gemini | `geminiApiKey` | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash, etc. |
| Ollama | `ollamaBaseUrl` | Default `http://localhost:11434` — local models |
| OpenAI-compatible | `openaiCompatibleBaseUrl` + `openaiCompatibleApiKey` | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

### Speech / voice keys

| Feature | Setting |
|---|---|
| ElevenLabs TTS | `elevenlabsApiKey` |
| Edge TTS (built-in) | No key required |
| Native macOS STT | No key required |
| Whisper STT | Runs locally — no key required |
| Parakeet STT | Runs locally via swift-transformers — no key required |

- `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY`
- `SUPERMEMORY_CLIENT`
- `SUPERMEMORY_BASE_URL`
- `SUPERMEMORY_LOCAL`

## Privacy & Security

SuperCmd is open-source, so you can audit exactly what it does. The short version:

- **Telemetry**: one anonymous `app_started` event via [Aptabase](https://aptabase.com/).
- **AI prompts**: sent directly from your device to your configured provider (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Ollama).
- **Extension install/uninstall**: reports extension name + an anonymous random machine ID to `api.supercmd.sh` for download counts.
- **Voice data**: STT runs fully on-device (Whisper, Parakeet, native macOS) — audio never leaves your machine.

See **[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md)** for the full breakdown.
